## What is it?
Cogito is a First Person Immersive Sim Template Project for Godot 4, providing a framework for creating interactable objects, various items to use and mechanics to influence the player and game environment.
In short, with COGITO you get a quick start for a fully-featured first person game with a great variety of mechanics and a solid base to create your own.

## Principles of this template
The structure of this template always tries to adhere to the following principles:
- **Complete**: When you download COGITO and press play, you get a functioning project out of the box. Game menu, save slot select, options and a playable level are all included.
- **Versatile**: Whether your game is set in the future, the past or the present, use melee, projectile or no weapons at all, have low poly, stylized or realistic graphics, the template will have features for you.
- **Modular**: Do not want to use a feature? You will be able to hide it, ignore it or strip it out without breaking COGITO. At the same time, COGITO is designed to be extendable with your own custom features or other add-ons.
- **Approachable**: While there will always be a learning curve, we strive to make COGTIO approachable and intuitive to use, so it doesn't get in your way of making your game.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> COGITO v1.1 is not 100% bug-free. While most features are set, be aware that this is hobbyist open source software. Use at your own risk and check Issues and Discussion pages for more information.
